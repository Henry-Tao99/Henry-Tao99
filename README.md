👋 Hi, I’m @Henry-Tao99
👀 I’m working on an exciting project called AIDog, an advanced AI-driven robotic dog. My goal is to push the boundaries of robotics by creating a machine dog that can assist with personal companionship, home security, and elderly care.
🤝 Looking for collaborators: I’m seeking passionate robotics engineers, AI developers, and hardware integration specialists who are interested in developing this technology further. If you have experience in robotics, machine learning, or hardware-software integration, let’s collaborate!
🌱 Currently building upon the Weilan robot dog, I am focusing on secondary development for enhanced functionality, including autonomous behavior, security applications, and AI-powered interactions.
📫 How to reach me: orangeproto@gmail.com
💡 Let’s shape the future of robotics together!
